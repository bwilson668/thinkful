## Olympic Predictions
The 2016 Summer Olympics are about to start in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. The Olympics are a great international event to showcase your contries greatest athletes!

I wanted to see if there were any trends that could be uncovered to create a __Olympic Medal Predicitor__. I'm going to take my best shot at prediciting how many medals each country will win!

#### Questions
I hope to answer a few questions along the way.

- Is there a home field advantage? The host country could get a boost from the judges.
- Is there a regional advantage? Surrounding countries could easily bring more atheletes.
- Is there a correlation between a nation's GDP and medal count?
- Is there a correlation between a nation's population and medal count? What about those specifically between 18 and 40?

If there are more national indicators that could be checked for a correlation I will roll them in.

__Bonus Questions__
- Do countries specialize in certain sports / events?
- Are certain athletes more important to their country for acheiving Olympic success? For example: track atheletes could medal in multiple events.
- What are the differences between Summer and Winter Olympics?
    - Does a countries latitude influence their seasonal Olympic performance? For example: a Jamacian bobsled team!

Once I find an answer to these questions, I should be able to create a prediction for this year's Olympics through a regression model.

### Data
I'll need to gather, clean, and blend data from many sources.

I'm looking for:
- GDP by nation by year
- Population by nation by year by age / age range
- Nation latitude and longitude
- Nation region
- Olympic year
- Olympic season
- Olympic host
- Olympic sports / events
- Olympic medals by nation by year

### Sources
The World Bank has been a great resource for national indicators.
