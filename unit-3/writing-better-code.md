# Writing better code
#### Ben Wilson

### Styling
My editor has automatic PEP 8 linting.

I've used Jupyter Notebook's for the most part, so my styling has been a non-issue.

### Generators and Functions
I'll use list comprehensions in place of map() or filter().
After I am done debugging I'll change the list comprehension to a generator. This will save on memory.

### Testing
TDD is common practice for me in other languages. If I dig into Python developement I'll develop this workflow in Python.

### Regex
I've utilized Regex in every language I've worked with. I still do not have it memorized, but it's easy to lookup online.
